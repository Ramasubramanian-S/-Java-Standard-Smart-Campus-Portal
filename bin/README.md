## 📝 Sprint Review

### ✅ What Was Planned
- Set up a GitHub repository with branches for each member
- Build a responsive registration form using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap
- Implement form validation using jQuery
- Create a shell script to automate code backup with timestamps
- Use Jira for sprint planning and task tracking

### 📌 What Was Delivered
- GitHub repository initialized and collaborators added
- Fully responsive form developed and tested across devices
- Field validation logic added (email, password, phone, etc.)
- Bash script created for backup automation
- Jira board organized with Epics, Stories, and Tasks, all updated

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Initial unfamiliarity with Jira for sprint management
- UI bugs on mobile view (overlapping input fields)
- Delays in debugging jQuery form validations
- Styling issues in calendar widget across browsers
- Accidentally removed the shebang line in shell script (later fixed)

---

## 📘 Learnings
- Hands-on experience using Agile with Jira (Epics → Stories → Tasks)
- Applied GitHub collaboration: branches, pull requests, conflict resolution
- Gained frontend skills: Bootstrap grids, media queries, responsive design
- Learned to write and debug basic shell scripts
- Validated cross-browser behavior in real-world forms

---

## 🔁 Retrospective

### ✔️ What Went Well
- Team roles were clearly assigned
- Jira and GitHub were used effectively for sprint execution
- Deliverables were completed on time

### ❌ What Didn’t Go Well
- Initial time loss learning Jira
- Validation logic debugging took longer than expected
- Minor issues in mobile UI and image upload feedback

---

## 📈 Action Items for Next Sprint
- Connect the registration form to a backend service and database
- Add user redirection and confirmation message on form submission
- Improve shell script: add logging and cleanup of old backups
- Start implementing user login and authentication module
- Explore frontend testing tools (e.g., Cypress, Selenium)
